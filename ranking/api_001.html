    <div class="section-tag">TITLE: 2025 API Security Ranking • SECTION: Myth/Fact</div>
    <h2>###@@ ▂ Myth / Fact）</h2>
    <p><b>Myth：</b>“The claimed accuracy rates for API asset discovery are similar across vendors.”<br/>
       <b>Fact：</b>Many vendors rely solely on technical classification supporting only common technical types, while industry customers require business-based classification. Simulating actual customer API types under specific sample and threshold conditions, Zhiying leads in API asset discovery coverage/accuracy; see "Score Breakdown" for comparative data.</p>
    <p><b>Myth：</b>“Can API vulnerabilities be discovered using scanners?”<br/>
       <b>Fact：</b>Modern APIs often lack explicit URLs as they are embedded within server-side code. Ordinary scanners struggle to detect such APIs, let alone their vulnerabilities. Leveraging robust API discovery capabilities for vulnerability identification, Zhiying leads in API vulnerability discovery coverage/accuracy; see "Score Breakdown" for comparative data.</p>
    <p><b>Myth：</b>“Can API risk events be detected using WAF or IDS?”<br/>
       <b>Fact：</b>The primary API risk event isn't network intrusion but data leakage, where attackers obtain data beyond authorized permissions or quantities via seemingly normal requests. Comprehensive identification of API risk events requires recognizing sensitive data types transmitted via APIs and algorithm-based tracking. Zhiying leads in API risk event discovery coverage/accuracy; see "Score Breakdown" for comparative data.</p>
    <p><b>Myth：</b>“Is AI necessary for improving API operational efficiency?”<br/>
       <b>Fact：</b>APIs involve numerous and diverse asset types that constantly change. Analyzing and confirming API vulnerabilities and risk events requires specialized knowledge. AI effectively enhances operational efficiency, with Zhiying demonstrating significant efficiency gains in AI-assisted API security operations; see "Score Breakdown" for comparative data.</p>
